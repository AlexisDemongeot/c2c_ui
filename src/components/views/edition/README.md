What is the logic behind field distribution in edition views ?

* first tab, called General informations
  * all mandatory fields
  * and the shortest possible list of most used fields.
  * Ideally, this tab must not have vertical scroll  
* then, in other tabs
  * fields with common sense are keeped together, on the same row if possible
  * then, rows are ordered by usefullness
